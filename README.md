# Faculty-Online-Result-Management-Dashboard
This project, Online Results Management System was carried out to automate the manual processes of compiling Students Examination Results. It was necessitated because of some setbacks in manual result processing. The system was designed to automatically take raw scores from excel files and store them in a database. It used past processed results to help the next course registration prior to results upload. Its result processing features includes the computation of grade point average (GPA), generation of result reporting sheets and transcripts. The essence is to design an efficient computerized system that will replace manual result processing which is prone to lot of paper work and errors. This reduces the tedious tasks involved, and enhances students' performance through timely publication of results.
